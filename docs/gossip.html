        Introduction
    </h2>

    <p>
        The paper we're tackling here - "Differentiated Consistency for Worldwide Gossips" - is about gossip, with a
        twist. Gossip algorithms are an awesome class of algorithms that before tackling this paper I never really
        delved into, so I'm happy to have had this chance to explore them at a little depth and hopefully I don't have
        glaring mistakes. In a gossip algorithm, you have a bunch of computers, typically at least in the hundreds,
        where they try to keep a shared data structure consistent and up to date between them by having each one gossip
        the updates to the others. In the paper, they extend the basic gossip algorithm so that a privileged group
        of computers - what they term primaries - get early word of any updates so they are more up-to-date on any
        updates on average, while the rest get their updates a bit later but in a tighter timeframe so they're more
        consistent with each other even as they're a bit behind.
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't worry if most of the previous paragraph didn't make sense - we'll go into all of that in more depth in the
        rest of this article.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Gossip basics
    </h2>

    <p>
        In a gossip network, a bunch of participants (typically different computers, but let's call them nodes) are all
        trying to maintain a common data structure. In the running example we'll have throughout, the nodes will all be
        communicating about the color of a magic goose in terms of whether or not it has Red, Green and/or Blue. So in
        the beginning they'll all agree that the goose is black (no R, G or B). But at various points any of them will
        want to issue updates like:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>I see some Red! Let's all update the color to add Red!</li>
        <li>I see Blue! Let's all update the color to add Blue!</li>
        <li>Actually I don't see Red at all! Let's all remove the Red from the color.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Whenever any of them wants to issue such an update, they'll update their local state then will send a message of
        the update to a random subset of other nodes (the size of this subset is called the <i>fanout</i>). And whenever
        any node receives such an update message that it hasn't seen before, it'll update its local state and then pass
        the message on to another random subset. And if all goes well, all the nodes will hear about this update and
        consensus will be achieved and they'll be closer to figuring out the true color of the magic goose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two important points to emphasize here about this basic description:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Nodes can get updates in any order, and they should be resilient to that.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a node gets a message that it has seen before, it just drops it. So each node needs to remember the
            messages it received so duplicates can be dropped.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We'll talk more about the first point below. The second point is how gossip messages don't just end up
        circulating forever. In the literature this is talked about in terms of an epidemic model: nodes get infected
        with a message ("add Red"), infect a random subset of other nodes, then get cured and develop immunity against
        that message such that if another node tries to send it the same message again it'll just drop it. And since
        epidemiologist have already figured out a bunch of math around infection rates and the conditions needed for the
        disease/message to infect everyone and so on, we can just use this math to figure out good fanout rates for
        ourselves! And all it cost is a little bit of a macabre analogy.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, here is a uniform gossip network. Press the red/green/blue buttons to add/remove those colors:
    </p>

    <table id="uniform-gossip">
        <tr>
            <td colspan="100%"><canvas id="gossip-canvas"></canvas></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><button id="blue" type="button" style="background-color: blue; height: 20px; width: 50px;">Blue</button>
            </td>
            <td><button id="green" type="button"
                    style="background-color: green; height: 20px; width: 50px;">Green</button></td>
            <td><button id="red" type="button" style="background-color: red; height: 20px; width: 50px;">Red</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>
        Resilient data structures
    </h2>

    <p>
        As stated above, our data structure needs to be resilient to messages/updates arriving in different orders, and
        still converge to the same end state. For example a node can hear about removing Red before it hears about that
        Red should be added at all, and if the nodes want to be consistent at the end, they should have the same end
        state regardless of order of messages. So ["add Red", "add Blue", "remove Red"] should be the same as ["remove
        red", "add Blue", "add Red"] - namely both sequences of messages should result in the end state of "Blue".
    </p>

    <p>
        In the paper they give the example of an append-only queue and how to maintain that, but I ended up implementing
        a set instead for this post's purposes. You can find the code for this <code>GossipSet</code> in the
        <code>pheromessage</code> repository <a
            href="https://github.com/mooso/pheromessage/blob/main/pheromessage/src/data.rs">here</a>. The technique used
        is to keep a pair of counters for each element for the number of times it was added removed. So if a node gets
        three messages to "add Blue", and two messages to "remove Blue", then it'll maintain that it got 3 additions and
        2 removals of Blue (regardless of order). And at that point it can conclude that Blue is indeed present in the
        set (so an element is present if the number of additions is greater than the number of removals).
    </p>

    <p>
        The set is the easy structure which is why I picked it. The paper's append-only queue mechanism is more clever
        and uses logical (Lamport) clocks to achieve this resiliency, so you should check it out.
    </p>

    <h2>
        The privileged few
    </h2>

    <p>
        So the basic gossip is all well and good, but what if you want a (small) subset of nodes to always get updates
        first? The paper gives an example of a blockchain where you want the mining nodes to get updates quicker than
        passive nodes, but I can also imagine needing this in a variety of cases where a few nodes can act as more
        authoritative sources of much more up-to-date data, and the rest are backup nodes for less critical use cases
        (e.g. analytics) where being super up-to-date isn't very critical, and they can afford to be a little bit
        behind.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I love about this paper is that the algorithm modification is fairly simple, but it works and most of the
        paper is dedicated to proving its effectiveness. The tweaks over the basic gossip algorithm are:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>When an update is first done by any node (primary or secondary) - the gossip messages are sent to a subset
            of the primary nodes instead of choosing among all the nodes.</li>
        <li>When a primary node receives a gossip message, if it's the first time it's seen it then the gossip is sent
            to a subset of the primary nodes. Otherwise if it's the second time it's seen it then it'll send gossip to
            the secondaries (if it's seen it more than twice then it's dropped - the node is immune now).</li>
        <li>Secondaries only gossip to secondaries when they receive gossip messages.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The intuition behind this is that gossip is first sent to the primary sub-network where it circulates quickly,
        and as the primary nodes get first infection only then do they start sending word to the secondaries where they
        gossip it among themselves. This lets primaries get low latency on updates (since they're first to hear), and
        secondaries be more consistent since when they first get word about an update, they'll get a bunch of primaries
        sending messages to them so updates reach all of them very soon after the first one hears about it.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, here is a preferential gossip network like the one above, but now a subset of the network (the
        top 5 rows) is designated "high priests" and will get first word of any gossip about colors. Press the
        red/green/blue buttons to add/remove those colors:
    </p>

    <table id="preferential-gossip">
        <tr>
            <td colspan="100%"><canvas id="gossip-canvas"></canvas></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><button id="blue" type="button" style="background-color: blue; height: 20px; width: 50px;">Blue</button>
            </td>
            <td><button id="green" type="button"
                    style="background-color: green; height: 20px; width: 50px;">Green</button></td>
            <td><button id="red" type="button" style="background-color: red; height: 20px; width: 50px;">Red</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
