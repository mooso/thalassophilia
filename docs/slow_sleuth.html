        Introduction
    </h2>

    <p>
        For this post we'll be discussing the paper:
        "Vapro: Performance Variance Detection and Diagnosis for Production-Run Parallel Applications".
        This paper was such a delight for me to find, because it discusses a problem that vexed me quite a bit
        in my career with large scale distributed applications and I for some reason thought it was too niche a
        problem for anyone else to do deep research on, but I was very happy to find out I was wrong (which honestly
        is not too surprising in hindsight).
    </p>

    <h2>
        The problem
    </h2>

    <p>
        Let's say we have a huge data set that we want to search for something in. Easy enough we think, this
        is classic map reduce problem where we partition the data set into N (say, a thousand) roughly equal sized
        portions, tell our mighty cluster of a thousand machines to each take a piece and search in there (the map
        phase), then combine the results (the reduce phase) from all of them. If each piece takes ten seconds to search
        through, then we should have our results after around ten seconds (assuming our map reduce system is low
        overhead).
    </p>

    <p>
        So we whip that up, launch our jobs, watch in giddiness as the entire cluster is busy for ten seconds
        then we just wait for our results. And wait. And wait. And almost every machine is idle, but one or two
        are still busy churning even after a minute! What happened? We double check and our partitioning was fine,
        the data sizes given to those stragglers was indeed around the same as everyone else. So why did they take
        that much longer to search through their pieces, and hold us all up?
    </p>

    <p>
        It's easy to forget, but modern computers are very complex beasts. And even if we get presumably identical
        machines, say AWS instances of the same instance type or servers assembled from the same component types,
        we can still get variations in there intentional or not: maybe the components have different vendors, maybe
        the SSDs have different firmware versions and one of the versions has a bug, maybe one of the cores of CPU has a
        subtle bug that causes a slowdown in certain types of workloads. Or maybe it's not a hardware problem at
        all: maybe when we ran our workload one of the machines' started to run a background OS update job, or the
        machine had just booted up so its caches were cold, ....
    </p>

    <p>
        Any of those causes, or one of many more I have no idea about, could cause performance variation in what
        should be identical work. This can not only cause problems in batch processing jobs like the example I gave,
        but also can cause a production service to process some requests much slower than others, which can be a
        very frustrating experience for some of your customers if you advertise really fast service and everyone raves
        about how fast it really is, but the unlucky ones are getting a horrible experience.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Some classic approaches
    </h2>

    <p>
        This is not a new problem, and engineers have been living with this in one way or another for a while now.
        Some approaches that I'm personally familiar with:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Just rerun your job/refresh your web page and hope you get luckier</li>
        <li>Timeout/retry the slow portion: this is essentially a refinement of the above, but instead of waiting for a
            human to get frustrated and retry the whole thing, you can have machines give up after a reasonable time
            and retry just the parts that were slow. This can get much trickier than you'd think to get right, you can
            see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/">this
                article</a>
            by Marc Brooker for example about all the considerations there.
        </li>
        <li>Speculative execution: run your processing on two machines instead of one, and just take the results from
            the faster one. This can be done for every request in a service if it's lightweight enough, or an
            orchestrator/frontend machine can monitor each job/request and launch speculative backup executions if one
            is taking too long. I personally love that approach, and Hadoop and other big frameworks support it, but
            it's complex to get working correctly and efficiently and of course can be impossible/much more complex for
            anything that has side effects.
        </li>
        <li>Monitoring: Hook all your processing on all machines to a monitoring system, and alarm (or even better,
            automatically remediate/replace) when any machine is consistently slower than the rest.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Typically large complex systems need multiple approaches. The paper we're discussing is in the Monitoring
        genere of solutions, but with some new ideas and innovations that were very interesting to me.
    </p>

    <h2>
        General approach
    </h2>

    <p>
        The way the Vapro system/paper tackles this problem is as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Hook into the code to detect snippets of execution and how long each execution took</li>
        <li>Aggregate this information into average times taken for similar amounts of work</li>
        <li>Ship these aggregates to a central monitoring system that can detect when any one machine is
            taking longer to do the same amount of work.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        For hooking into code, they used a very clever technique of intercepting calls to dynamic libraries.
        This is not a super new technique but it fits well here. If you're not familiar: typically large systems
        use libraries to do standard things, and if you don't want to change the system but do want to monitor
        it (like we do here), you can intercept calls to the library and insert your monitoring code in there.
        So e.g. in the High Performance Computing (HPC) world the authors clearly hail from, the programs
        typically use a Message Passing Interface (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI</a>) library to pass messages
        between computers, and one can insert the monitoring code every time a call is made there to send or
        receive a message.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's a great approach, but personally I tend to like more explicit approaches when possible. When playing
        with the techniques of this paper for the code here, I ended up instead hooking into code using the
        Rust <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/">tracing</a> library which defines standard ways
        to insert monitoring hooks into the code (to the authors' credit - their system also supports explicit hooks).
    </p>

    <p>
        Where I got really excited personally though is in the next part: aggregating timing for similar
        amounts of work. This is trickier than it sounds. Say you're monitoring queries on a database. One
        query takes 10 milliseconds to run on machine A, and another on B takes 100 milliseconds. Does that mean
        that A is ten times faster than B? Not necessarily. The first query could be on a much smaller subset
        of data, or it could be on data already cached in memory, or it could have better suited indexes
        supporting it, or any of a myriad of ways the queries are different. In general it's very hard to
        say that any two executions are "similar amounts of work", except in very specific/lucky cases.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before this paper, there were two main approaches I'd used/seen used for this (typically combined):
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Define at the application layer some class of work that's similar enough: say any text search on texts less
            than 1 MB will count as the same</li>
        <li>Aggregate lots of executions together and hope the differences wash out</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This kind of works. But defining the limits in the application is arbitrary and depends on humans with all
        their follies, and aggregating lots of executions ignores systemic biases (e.g. maybe one machine gets
        unlucky with a particularly gnarly workload).
    </p>

    <p>
        The paper suggests a completely new (to me) approach: whenever any piece of code runs, it uses hardware
        performance counters to see the amount of computing work that was done. So e.g. the performance counter
        <code>TOT_INS</code> tracks the number of CPU instructions actually executed while the code ran. It collects
        a few of these counters into a workload vector, then uses a simple clustering algorithm to group similar
        executions together and aggregate the timings for each cluster. So this way we automatically get that e.g.
        finding the best route in Manhattan takes 10 milliseconds on average, while finding a route in Cairo takes
        500 milliseconds without explicitly specifying that those two tasks should be grouped separately.
    </p>

    <p>
        This auto-clustering technique was eye-opening to me. I love that they use performance counters for this,
        especially that this also helped them diagnose actual causes for slowdowns instead of just blaming supernatural
        computing forces like I would've done (they include a great anecdote in the paper about finding a CPU with a
        specific bug that was causing a performance problem this way). But when I started playing with it I decided
        that I don't have to limit myself to that, and as long as I can construct a vector of quantities that are
        roughly correlated to the amount of work being done I should be able to get the same benefit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately I went with a slightly different approach: for every code execution, I count how many times
        each instrumented function/event is called, and use that as the "workload vector". So here is an example:
        I have a simulation of many polygons in a square (a "polygon park") and for every frame (tick) I run collision
        detection to figure out if the polygons are colliding and need to bounce off each other. The algorithm for
        this (<a href="https://dyn4j.org/2010/01/sat/">SAT</a>) involves projections on different axes, so on each
        frame we'll end up calling the <code>project()</code> function a different amount of times depending on
        how close the polygons are to each other. So the monitoring code just clusters the executions of the
        <code>tick</code> invocations together based on how many projections were done, and outputs the averages
        of timings per cliuster. A simple example is below - trying starting the simulation and seeing the timings
        on your device.
    </p>

    <table id="polygon-park">
        <tr>
            <td colspan="100%"><canvas id="park-canvas" width="500" height="500" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;"></canvas></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><button id="start-reset" type="button" style="height: 20px;">Start</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Finally the last part is getting all this data into a central system to spot anomalies. The paper/system
        in there produces really nice heat maps that can help spot if any machine/CPU is much slower than the others
        at a glance. That part was relatively straightforward so I'm not going to expand further on it.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Closing thoughts
    </h2>

    <p>
        I really enjoyed the insight in this paper about treating a production system as a blackbox without explicit
        hooks, and still being able to extract and cluster similar amounts of work and detecting anomalies around
        different execution time for the same/similar amounts of work. It's a very important concept, and I'm glad
        to see innovations on that front. The evaluation of the system in the paper proved that even with this
        auto-clustering, monitoring of performance-sensitive systems can be done with a very small overhead. It struck
        me as a very practical approach that I'm hoping will help us all catch those slow machines in the wild and
        deal with them before they cause too much havoc.
